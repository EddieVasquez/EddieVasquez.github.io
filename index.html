<h1>About me</h1>

<fieldset class="word">
    My name is Eduardo Vasquez and I am 19 years old. I live in Brownsville Texas, which is in the most southern part of Texas.
    In my free time I like to read fantasy or sci-fi books. I also enjoy watching shows like Doctor Who
    and Dragon Ball Super.
</fieldset>

<h1>My Background</h1>

<fieldset class="word">
  I graduated from high school in 2016 and I attended The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley
for a year before I heard about this program and decided to do this instead.

<h1>Why Programing?</h1>

<fieldset class="word">
    I chose programming because I fell in love with it when I took a computer science class in high school.
    It was fairly simple for me to catch on yet challenging enough to keep me entertained. With
    this course, I plan to develop my programing skills further and learn as many languages as possible.
